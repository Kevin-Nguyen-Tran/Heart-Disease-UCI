# Heart-Disease-UCI

## Abstract

This analysis deals with exploring disease status and understanding the relationship it has with a multitude of different variables and factors. Specifically, we aim for a better understanding of how sex (male and female), age, serum cholesterol levels, chest pain, blood pressure (bp), and maximum heart rate (hr) plays a part in the prevalence of heart disease. The following variables will be analyzed individually and then used to create a generalized binomial linear model to predict the probability of not having heart disease. The data represented in this analysis can be found at [archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

**The data analysis will be broken down by the following sections:**

* Sex and Disease Status

* Age and Disease Status

* Serum Cholesterol Levels and Disease Status

* Chest Pain and Disease Status

* Resting Blood Pressure and Disease Status

* Maximum Heart Rate Achieved per Patient and Disease Status

* Logistic Linear Regression - Binomial and Disease Status Predictions
